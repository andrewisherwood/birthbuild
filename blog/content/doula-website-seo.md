SEO sounds technical. It sounds like something you need a specialist for. It sounds expensive.

For a local doula business, it is none of those things.

## What SEO actually means for doulas

SEO stands for search engine optimisation. For a doula, it means one thing: showing up when families in your area search for support.

The searches that matter to you are local. "Doula near me." "Birth doula Bristol." "Postnatal doula South London." These are the searches you want to appear for.

## The three things that actually matter

You do not need to understand algorithms or build backlinks. For a local doula business, three things drive 90% of your results.

### Google Business Profile

This is the single most important thing you can do for local SEO. It is free. It takes 20 minutes to set up. And it is what powers the map results when someone searches "doula near me."

### Location keywords on your website

Make sure your website mentions your location on every page. In your page titles. In your headings. In your service descriptions. "Birth doula support in Bristol and surrounding areas."

### Directory listings

Get listed in every relevant directory. Doula UK. Find My Doula. The Doula Directory. NCT. Each listing is a signal to Google that your business is real and operates where you say it does.

## What you can skip

You do not need to blog every week. You do not need to obsess over meta tags. You do not need to hire an SEO consultant.

Get the three basics right and let time do its work.

BirthBuild builds local SEO into every site automatically. Schema markup, location-specific content, semantic HTML, and unique meta tags on every page. One less thing to think about.
