Here's something nobody tells you during doula training. You can be the most skilled, compassionate, deeply intuitive birth worker in your area. And none of that matters if families can't find you.

Word of mouth is wonderful. Instagram has its moments. But the families who need you most are the ones typing "doula near me" into Google at midnight. They're anxious. They're researching. They want to feel an immediate sense of trust when they land on your site. And they will make a decision about you within seconds.

Your website is doing one of two things right now. It's either working for you around the clock, building trust and generating enquiries while you sleep. Or it's sitting there looking a bit tired, ranking on page four, quietly costing you clients you'll never know about.

This guide is the fix. Page by page, element by element. What goes where, why it matters, and what to do if design makes your brain want to shut down.

## Before You Build Anything

There are three questions to answer first. Skip these and you'll end up rebuilding the whole thing in six months.

**Who is your ideal client?** Not "pregnant people." Specifically. First-time parents in south London who want a calm, informed birth experience. Or experienced families planning a home birth who want someone who's been there. Or new mums who are drowning in the postnatal fog and need practical support. The more specific you get, the better your website copy will be. You can serve a broad range of families and still speak to a specific person on your site.

**What area do you cover?** This matters more than you think. Google ranks local businesses based on location relevance. If your website doesn't say where you work, Google can't show you to the families searching in your area. Be specific. Name the boroughs, the towns, the postcodes. "I support families across south west London including Wimbledon, Kingston, Richmond, and Wandsworth" is infinitely better than "I work in the London area."

**What do you want visitors to do?** The answer is almost always "book a free discovery call" or "fill in my contact form." Every single page on your site should point toward that action. Every page. Not just the contact page.

## Your Homepage

This is where most visitors land. You have about five seconds before they decide to stay or leave. No pressure.

**The hero section.** This is the big visual at the top. It needs three things. A warm, professional photo of you. Not a stock image of a random pregnant woman. You. Families are inviting you into one of the most intimate experiences of their lives. They need to see your face. Next to or overlaying your photo, a clear headline that says what you do and where. "Birth and Postnatal Doula in Brighton" works. "Holding Sacred Space for Transformative Journeys" does not. Not as a headline anyway. Save the poetry for your about page. And a button. A big, obvious, unmissable button. "Book a Free Chat" or "Get in Touch." Right there in the hero. Don't make people scroll to find out how to contact you.

**The "what is a doula" section.** You know what a doula is. Your website visitors probably don't. Not fully. A brief, warm explanation of what you do and how you support families goes right below the hero. Two or three sentences. Written for someone who's never heard the word doula before. This section does double duty. It educates visitors and it helps Google understand what your site is about.

**Services overview.** Not the full breakdown. That lives on your services page. Here you want two or three cards or blocks. Birth Doula Support. Postnatal Doula Support. Maybe a third offering like hypnobirthing or antenatal sessions. Each one gets a sentence or two and a link to the full services page. Keep it scannable.

**A testimonial or two.** Social proof on the homepage is not optional. One or two short quotes from families you've supported. Real names if you have permission. "Sarah supported us through our home birth and we couldn't have done it without her" hits differently than a generic five-star rating. If you're brand new and don't have testimonials yet, skip this section temporarily and add it the moment you have your first.

**About teaser.** A photo of you again (yes, again) with two or three lines about who you are and why you do this work. Link to the full about page. People want to know you're a real human with a real story.

**Call to action.** The page ends with another clear CTA. Same button. Same action. "Ready to chat about how I can support you? Book a free discovery call." Don't introduce a new action here. Keep it simple. One website, one primary action.

## Your About Page

This is usually the second most visited page on any doula website. Families want to know who you are. Not just what you do. Who you are.

**Start with them, not you.** The most common mistake on doula about pages is opening with "I've always been passionate about birth." Your visitor doesn't care yet. They will. But first they need to feel seen. Open with their experience. "You're pregnant. Maybe for the first time. Maybe after a birth that didn't go the way you hoped. You're looking for someone who'll be in your corner." Now they're listening.

**Then tell your story.** How you came to birth work. What drives you. Your training and qualifications. Doula UK membership if you have it. The training programme you completed. Any specialisms. Keep it personal but professional. This isn't your full autobiography. It's the version of your story that helps families trust you.

**Include a proper photo.** Professional if you can afford it. But a well-lit, warm, natural photo taken by a friend works too. You smiling. You looking approachable. Not a headshot from a corporate photoshoot. Not a blurry selfie. Somewhere in between.

**Qualifications and accreditations.** List them. Doula UK recognised mentor. BirthBliss trained. Hypnobirthing practitioner. Whatever you've got. Some families specifically look for Doula UK accreditation. Make it easy to find.

**End with a CTA.** "I'd love to hear about your birth wishes. Book a free chat and let's see if we're a good fit."

## Your Services Page

This is where the business happens. Families arrive here ready to understand what you offer and how much it costs.

**Separate your services clearly.** If you offer birth doula support and postnatal doula support, these need to be clearly distinct sections. Maybe separate pages if each service is substantial enough. Don't lump everything into one wall of text.

**Describe what's included.** Not in vague terms. Specifically. "Two antenatal visits at your home. On-call support from 38 weeks. Continuous support throughout your labour and birth. One postnatal visit within the first week." Families want to know exactly what they're getting. Specificity builds trust.

**Show your pricing.** This is controversial in the doula world. Some prefer to keep pricing for the discovery call. But the data and the trend both point toward showing it. Families who can see your prices self-qualify. You waste less time on calls with people who can't afford your services. And Google can rank your page for "doula prices" and "how much does a doula cost" which are high-volume search terms.

If you're uncomfortable showing exact figures, show a range. "Birth doula packages start from £1,200." That's enough for someone to know whether you're in their budget.

**Offer packages.** A single flat rate works. But tiered packages work better. An essential package, a complete package, and a premium package give families a sense of choice and control. The middle option is almost always the most popular.

**CTA on every service.** After each service description, a button. "Book a free chat to discuss birth doula support." Don't make them scroll back up or navigate to a separate page. The moment they're interested is the moment they should be able to act.

## Your Testimonials

Testimonials convert. Full stop. Families trust other families more than they trust your marketing copy.

**Get them early and often.** After every birth or postnatal contract, ask for a testimonial. Give families a prompt if they're not sure what to write. "What was your experience of having doula support? How did it help? Would you recommend it to other families?" Most people want to help. They just need a nudge.

**Use real names and context.** "Jessica, first-time mum, home birth in Clapham" is more powerful than "J.S." Obviously get consent. But most families are happy to be named.

**Scatter them everywhere.** Don't just put testimonials on a dedicated testimonials page that nobody visits. Put them on your homepage. On your services page. On your about page. On your contact page. Wherever a visitor might hesitate, a testimonial provides reassurance.

**Google reviews matter too.** Encourage families to leave a Google review as well. Google reviews appear directly in search results and significantly boost your local SEO. A doula with fifteen five-star Google reviews will outrank a doula with zero every time.

## Your FAQ Page

This page does two things. It answers real questions that families have. And it ranks for long-tail search queries that you'd never target with a dedicated page.

**Start with the obvious questions.** What is a doula? How is a doula different from a midwife? When should I hire a doula? How much does a doula cost? Do you work with NHS or private care? Will you attend a hospital birth, home birth, or birth centre? What happens if you're at another birth when I go into labour?

**Add questions specific to your practice.** What area do you cover? Do you offer payment plans? Can my partner be involved? What training have you completed? Are you Doula UK recognised?

**Write proper answers.** Not one-liners. A paragraph each at minimum. These are content-rich pages that Google loves. Each question and answer pair is an opportunity to rank for a specific search term. "How much does a doula cost in London" is a question real people type into Google. If your FAQ page answers it well, you show up.

**Use FAQ schema markup.** This is the technical bit. FAQ schema tells Google that your page contains questions and answers, and Google can display them directly in search results as expandable dropdowns. This massively increases your visibility. If you're on WordPress, the Yoast plugin handles this. If your website builder supports custom code, the schema can be added manually. If you're on BirthBuild, it's done automatically.

## Your Contact Page

The simplest page on your site and somehow the one most doulas get wrong.

**Make it easy.** A contact form with three or four fields. Name, email, due date or reason for enquiry, message. That's it. Don't ask for their life story. Don't make them select from seventeen dropdown menus.

**Include alternatives.** Some people hate forms. Give them an email address. A phone number if you're comfortable with that. A link to book a discovery call directly through Calendly or a similar tool. Multiple paths to the same outcome.

**State your response time.** "I'll get back to you within 24 hours" sets expectations and reduces the anxiety of reaching out. Families contacting a doula are often doing something that feels vulnerable. Make it feel safe.

**Repeat your service area.** One more time. "I support families across [your area]." This reinforces the local SEO signal on yet another page.

## Your Blog

Not essential at launch. But the single most powerful thing you can do for long-term SEO.

A blog lets you rank for dozens or hundreds of keywords that your main pages can't target. "What to pack in your hospital bag." "How to write a birth plan." "Benefits of delayed cord clamping." "What does a postnatal doula actually do." Every blog post is a new door into your website. A new way for a family to discover you.

Write about what you know. Answer the questions families ask you in real life. The ones that come up in every antenatal visit. The ones you get asked in your DMs. Each one of those questions is a blog post waiting to happen.

Aim for 1,500 words minimum per post. Include your location naturally. Link back to your services page. Publish consistently, even if that's just once or twice a month.

## The Technical Stuff You Can't Skip

This is the bit that makes most doulas' eyes glaze over. But it's the difference between a website that ranks and one that doesn't.

**Mobile responsive.** More than half your visitors will be on their phone. Probably scrolling at 2am while they can't sleep because they're 34 weeks pregnant and anxious. If your site doesn't look good on a phone, you've lost them.

**Page speed.** Slow sites kill conversions. Compress your images before uploading. Don't use enormous photos straight from your camera. Every image on your site should be under 200KB ideally. Run your site through Google PageSpeed Insights and fix anything flagged as red.

**SSL certificate.** Your site needs to run on HTTPS, not HTTP. Most modern hosts handle this automatically. If your URL shows "Not Secure" in the browser bar, families will bounce.

**Google Business Profile.** Set this up immediately. It's free. It's how you appear in Google Maps results and the local pack. Fill out every field. Add photos. Collect reviews. This is arguably more important for local SEO than your actual website.

**Google Search Console.** Also free. Submit your sitemap. Monitor which searches bring people to your site. Check for any indexing issues. This is your direct line to understanding how Google sees your website.

**Doula directories.** List your website everywhere relevant. Doula UK, The Doula Directory, Find My Doula. Each directory listing is a backlink to your site, which tells Google you're legitimate. And families browse these directories directly.
