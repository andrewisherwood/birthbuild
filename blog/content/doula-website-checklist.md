Building a doula website can feel overwhelming. What goes where. What to write. What to leave out.

This checklist breaks it down. Print it off. Work through it section by section. Tick things off as you go.

## Homepage essentials

Your homepage is your shop window. Most visitors decide within three seconds whether to stay or leave.

- Clear headline stating what you do and where you are based
- Professional photo of yourself
- One primary call to action above the fold
- Brief summary of your services
- At least one testimonial
- Your service area mentioned clearly

## About page must-haves

Your about page will be the most visited page on your site. Write it for your clients, not for yourself.

- Opening paragraph focused on what families get from working with you
- Your personal story and what drew you to birth work
- Your training and qualifications
- A warm, approachable photo
- Doula UK badge or other accreditation logos

## Services page

Be specific. Vague service descriptions do not convert.

- Each service listed with clear description
- What is included in each package
- Pricing or starting-from prices
- How to book or next steps
- Any extras or add-ons

## Contact page

Make it as easy as possible for families to reach you.

- Contact form with name, email, and message fields
- Email address (visible, not just the form)
- Phone number if you are happy to share
- Service area or areas you cover
- Response time expectation

## SEO basics

A beautiful site is pointless if families cannot find it.

- Unique page title for every page
- Meta description for every page
- Your location mentioned on every page
- Google Business Profile set up and verified
- Listed in at least two doula directories
- Schema.org structured data for local business
