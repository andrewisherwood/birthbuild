You know that feeling when you're packing for a birth and you run through your checklist one more time. Tens unit. Massage oil. Snacks. Battery pack. Affirmation cards. You've done this enough times to know that the thing you forget is the thing you'll need at 3am.

Your website is the same. Except instead of a tens unit, you're forgetting a call to action. Instead of snacks, you're missing your service area. And instead of realising at 3am, you just quietly lose clients for months without knowing why.

This is the checklist. Every element your doula website needs to build trust, rank in local search, and convert visitors into enquiries. Print it. Work through it. Tick things off. Come back to it every few months and check nothing's slipped.

## The Non-Negotiables

These are the elements that every doula website must have. Not "should have." Must have. A website missing any of these is actively losing you clients.

### A Professional Photo of You

Not a stock image. Not a silhouette. Not a Canva graphic with a lotus flower. You. Your face. Looking warm and approachable. Visible on the homepage, ideally above the fold, before anyone has to scroll.

Families are about to invite you into one of the most intimate experiences of their lives. They need to see who they're inviting. A website without a photo of you is like a dating profile without a picture. People will just keep scrolling.

Professional branding photography is ideal if you can afford it. A session costs £150 to £400 and gives you images for your website, social media, and directory listings. But a well-lit natural photo taken by a friend or partner works fine too. Stand near a window. Wear something you'd wear to an antenatal visit. Smile like you mean it. Done.

### Your Location and Service Area

Stated clearly. On your homepage. On your services page. On your about page. In your footer. In your page titles and meta descriptions.

"I support families across south west London, including Wimbledon, Kingston, Putney, Richmond, and Wandsworth." Not "London area." Not "south east England." Specific areas. Named.

This is not just for families reading your site. It's for Google. The algorithm needs to connect you with local searches. If your website never mentions where you work, Google can't show you to the family in Kingston searching "doula near me" right now.

Name every town, borough, and area you cover. On multiple pages. In slightly different wording each time. This is the single easiest SEO improvement most doula websites can make.

### A Clear Call to Action on Every Page

Every page on your website should answer the question "what do I want the visitor to do next?" For most doulas, the answer is "book a free discovery call" or "get in touch." That action should be visible on every single page. Not hidden at the bottom. Not only on the contact page. Everywhere.

Homepage hero section. Button. "Book a Free Chat." Services page, after each service description. Button. "Enquire About Birth Doula Support." About page, after your story. Button. "I'd Love to Hear About Your Birth Wishes." Blog post, at the end. Link. "Ready to chat? Get in touch."

One primary action. Repeated consistently. Make it so easy to contact you that a visitor would have to actively try to avoid it.

### Mobile-Friendly Design

More than half your visitors are on their phone. Probably more. A pregnant person lying in bed at midnight, scrolling, researching, slightly anxious. That's your visitor. If your site is clunky on mobile, if the text is tiny, if the buttons are too small to tap, if the menu doesn't work, they're gone. Back to Google. On to the next doula.

Test your site on your own phone. Can you read everything without zooming? Can you tap the contact button easily? Does the navigation work? Do images load quickly? If any of those answers is no, fix it before you do anything else.

### HTTPS (The Padlock)

Your website URL must start with https:// not http://. This means the connection between your visitor's browser and your website is encrypted. Most modern website builders and hosts handle this automatically. But check. If a visitor sees "Not Secure" in their browser bar when they visit your site, trust evaporates instantly. They're gone. Google also ranks HTTPS sites higher than HTTP sites.

## Homepage Elements

Your homepage is the front door. Most visitors arrive here first. It needs to do a lot of work in very little space.

### Hero Section

The top of your page. The first thing anyone sees. It needs three things working together.

A warm, professional image. Either a photo of you or a warm, relevant image that sets the tone. Full-width works well. Avoid clinical hospital imagery. Think hands, warmth, light, connection.

A clear headline. What you do and where. "Birth and Postnatal Doula in Brighton" works. "Supporting Your Sacred Journey" does not. Not as a headline. Clarity beats poetry when someone is scanning search results and landing pages at speed.

A call to action button. "Book a Free Discovery Call" or "Get in Touch." Right there. Immediately visible. Before anyone scrolls.

### What Is a Doula Section

Your website visitors might not know what a doula is. Or they might have a vague idea. A brief, two to three sentence explanation sits well below the hero. Written for someone who's never met a doula. Warm, clear, jargon-free. This also helps Google understand what your site is about, which matters for SEO.

### Services Overview

Not the full services page. A summary. Two or three cards or blocks. Birth Doula. Postnatal Doula. Maybe a third offering. Each gets a sentence and a link through to the detailed services page. Scannable. Visual. Quick.

### Social Proof

One or two testimonials from families you've supported. Real names with consent. Brief quotes that communicate trust and warmth. "Having Sarah there meant I could focus on my birth instead of worrying about everything else." Social proof on the homepage is not optional. It's the difference between "this looks nice" and "I trust this person."

### About Teaser

A second photo of you with two or three lines about who you are and a link to the full about page. Families want to feel a connection before they click through. Give them a reason to keep reading.

## About Page Elements

This is usually the second most-visited page on any doula website. It builds the human connection that turns a visitor into a client.

### Client-First Opening

Don't start with yourself. Start with them. "You're preparing for one of the biggest experiences of your life. Maybe you're excited. Maybe you're terrified. Maybe both. You're looking for someone who'll be calm when things feel chaotic." Now they feel seen. Now they're reading.

### Your Story

How you came to this work. What drives you. Why you get out of bed for a 2am call. This doesn't need to be your entire life history. It needs to be the version of your story that builds trust and connection. Personal but professional. Honest but boundaried.

### Qualifications and Training

List everything relevant. Doula UK membership. Training programme completed. Hypnobirthing certification. First aid. Breastfeeding support training. Any CPD. Some families specifically search for Doula UK recognised doulas. Others want to know you've done specific training. Make it easy to find.

### Professional Photo

Yes, another one. Different from the homepage photo ideally. Natural, warm, approachable. This page is where families decide if they like you. Give them something real to connect with.

## Services Page Elements

This is where the business conversation happens. Be clear. Be specific. Be generous with detail.

### Clear Service Separation

If you offer birth doula support and postnatal doula support, separate them clearly. Different sections at minimum. Different pages if you have enough to say about each. Don't make families hunt through a wall of text to figure out which service applies to them.

### What's Included

Specific. Not vague. Not "comprehensive support throughout your journey." Instead: "Two antenatal visits in your home. On-call support from 38 weeks. Continuous support throughout your labour and birth. One postnatal debrief visit within the first two weeks."

Specificity builds trust. It shows you've done this before. It tells families exactly what they're getting. It also helps with pricing psychology. When someone sees everything that's included, the price feels justified.

### Pricing

Show it. Or at minimum show a starting rate. "Birth doula packages from £1,200." This is increasingly standard in the UK doula market and the benefits outweigh the discomfort.

Families who can see your pricing self-qualify. You spend less time on discovery calls with people who can't afford your services. Your website ranks for "doula prices" and "how much does a doula cost" which are high-volume search terms. And transparency builds trust. In 2026, hiding your prices feels more suspicious than showing them.

If you offer tiered packages, show the tiers. Essential, Complete, Premium. Or whatever naming convention fits your brand. The middle tier almost always sells best.

### Individual CTAs

After each service description, a button. "Enquire About Birth Doula Support." "Book a Free Chat About Postnatal Care." Don't make someone scroll back to the top or navigate to a separate page. The moment interest peaks is the moment they should be able to act.

## Testimonials

### Real Quotes from Real Families

Named where possible. "Jessica, first-time mum, home birth in Clapham" is miles more powerful than "J from London." Get consent. Most families are happy to be named and quoted.

### Context and Specificity

The best testimonials are specific. "Sarah was there for 14 hours and I never once felt alone" hits harder than "Sarah was great." Prompt families when you ask. "What specifically was helpful? How did you feel having doula support? Would you recommend it to other families?"

### Scattered Across Your Site

Don't restrict testimonials to a dedicated testimonials page that nobody visits. Put them on your homepage. On your services page. On your about page. On your contact page. Wherever a visitor might hesitate, a testimonial provides the reassurance to keep going.

### Google Reviews

Separate from your website testimonials but equally important. Google reviews appear directly in search results and are a major factor in local search ranking. Ask every family to leave one. Send the direct link. Follow up once. Build this into your post-contract process so it becomes automatic.

## FAQ Page

### Common Questions Answered Properly

Not one-line answers. A proper paragraph for each. This is content that ranks for long-tail search terms. "How is a doula different from a midwife." "When should I hire a doula." "How much does a doula cost in [your area]." "What happens if my doula is at another birth." "Do you attend hospital births and home births."

Every question and answer is an SEO opportunity. Someone will type that exact question into Google. If your site answers it well, you show up.

### FAQ Schema Markup

The technical bit. FAQ schema tells Google your page contains structured questions and answers, which can be displayed as expandable dropdowns directly in search results. This massively increases your visibility. If you're on WordPress, Yoast or RankMath handle this. BirthBuild includes it automatically.

## Contact Page

### Simple Form

Three to four fields maximum. Name. Email. Due date or reason for enquiry. Message. That's it. Every additional field you add reduces the number of people who complete it. Don't ask for their phone number, address, postcode, how they heard about you, their birth preferences, and their mother's maiden name. Keep it short.

### Alternative Contact Methods

Email address for people who prefer email. Phone number if you're comfortable. A direct booking link through Calendly or similar for people who want to skip the form and just book a call. Multiple paths to the same outcome.

### Response Time Expectation

"I'll get back to you within 24 hours." Simple. Sets expectations. Reduces the anxiety of reaching out. Families contacting a doula are often doing something that feels quite vulnerable. Knowing they'll hear back quickly makes it easier to hit send.

### Service Area (Again)

One more time. "I support families in [your areas]." Reinforce the local SEO signal. Prevent enquiries from outside your area. Make it clear you're local and accessible.

## Footer Elements

Your footer appears on every page. It's quiet real estate that does important work.

### Service Area Listed

Every area you cover. This repetition across every page strengthens your local SEO signal.

### Accreditation Badges

Doula UK logo if you're a member. Training provider logos. Any relevant certifications. Badges build visual trust at a glance.

### Social Media Links

Instagram and Facebook at minimum if you're active on them. Don't link to social profiles you never update. A dormant Instagram is worse than no Instagram link at all.

### Legal Pages

Privacy policy. Terms of use if relevant. These are technically required under GDPR for any website that collects personal data (which your contact form does). Free generators exist online. Get it done.

## Blog (Recommended)

Not essential at launch but the most powerful long-term SEO tool available to you. Each blog post targets a specific keyword. Each post is a new page indexed by Google. Each post is a new way for families to discover your website.

Write about what families ask you. The questions that come up in every antenatal visit. The topics you're passionate about. Hospital bag lists. Birth plans. What to expect from a postnatal doula. How to choose a doula. Benefits of having a doula at a caesarean birth.

Aim for 1,500 words minimum. Publish on a consistent schedule, even if that's just twice a month. Link back to your services page from every post.

## Technical Essentials

### Google Business Profile

Set up and completely filled in. Photos uploaded. Service area defined. Category set. Reviews being actively collected. This is as important as your website for local visibility.

### Google Search Console

Free. Submit your sitemap. Monitor your search performance. Check for indexing issues. This is your direct window into how Google sees your site.

### Page Speed

Run your site through Google PageSpeed Insights (pagespeed.web.dev). Fix anything critical. Compress images before uploading. Aim for all images under 200KB.

### Sitemap

An XML file listing all your pages for Google. Most website builders generate this automatically. Submit it through Search Console.

### Directory Listings

Doula UK. The Doula Directory. Find My Doula. Google Business Profile. Yell.com. FreeIndex. Your training provider's directory. Any local parenting or birth networks. Each listing is a backlink and a discovery channel.
