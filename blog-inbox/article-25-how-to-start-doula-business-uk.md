You've been thinking about this for a while. Maybe since your own birth experience. Maybe since you held space for a friend and realised this is the thing you were supposed to be doing. Maybe you've already completed training and now you're staring at a blank screen wondering how to actually turn this into a business.

Starting a doula business in the UK is simpler than you think. There's no mandatory registration. No governing body you have to join. No formal qualification you legally need. That's both liberating and slightly terrifying. It means the barrier to entry is low, but it also means you have to build your own credibility from scratch.

This guide covers every step. Training, accreditation, the boring-but-essential admin, pricing, getting your first clients, and building a business that sustains you rather than burning you out. All specific to the UK. All practical. No inspirational fluff about following your calling.

You already know this is your calling. Let's get you set up.

## Step 1: Understand What You're Getting Into

Before you spend money on training, be honest with yourself about what doula work actually looks like day to day.

You're self-employed. That means no guaranteed income, no sick pay, no employer pension contributions. Your diary is unpredictable because babies don't arrive on schedule. You might be on call for two weeks straight, then have nothing for a month. You'll be awake at 3am more often than you'd like. You'll witness incredible moments and you'll witness difficult ones.

The emotional toll is real. Birth doesn't always go to plan. Postnatal work exposes you to families in crisis. You need boundaries and you need your own support system.

The financial reality is also worth understanding upfront. Most doulas in the UK don't do this full-time, at least not in the first year or two. Many build alongside other work or while their children are in school. Birth doula packages in the UK range from about £500 for newly trained doulas to £3,500 or more for experienced doulas in London. Postnatal doulas typically charge £15 to £30 per hour depending on location and experience. You might support two to four birth clients per month at capacity, but reaching capacity takes time.

None of this is meant to put you off. It's meant to prepare you. The doulas who build sustainable businesses are the ones who go in with realistic expectations and a plan.

## Step 2: Get Trained

There is no legal requirement to complete training before calling yourself a doula in the UK. Anyone can set up as one. But practically speaking, training is essential. It gives you the knowledge, the confidence, the network, and the credibility to work safely and professionally.

### Doula UK Approved Courses

Doula UK is the leading professional body for doulas in the UK. They approve training courses that meet their core curriculum standards. Completing a Doula UK approved course makes you eligible to join Doula UK as a member, which carries significant weight with families searching for a doula.

The main Doula UK approved training providers include:

**BirthBliss Doula Academy.** One of the most established providers. They've trained over 1,000 doulas. Accredited with FEDANT (Federation of Antenatal Educators). Courses run online and in person across the UK. Expect around four intensive training days plus home study modules, mentoring sessions, and coursework.

**Developing Doulas.** Running since 2007. Over 900 doulas trained. Offers a unique follow-on "Doulavation" course for ongoing business development support. Available online and in person. Strong community feel with ongoing peer support.

**Nurturing Birth.** Four training days (or five evenings) plus lifetime access to their online learning portal. Includes three mentoring sessions and ongoing support through weekly virtual meetups. Their certification is recognised by Doula UK. Known for a particularly warm, supportive training environment.

**The Doula Training Foundation.** Based in the North West. Four-day immersive in-person training led by experienced working doulas. Includes 18 months of one-to-one mentoring which is more generous than most providers. Strong emphasis on practical, real-world preparation.

**Every Birth Matters.** Based in Birmingham with online options. Doula UK approved. Currently updating their course delivery, so check their site for the latest format.

### Other Training Routes

**The Original Birth Connection.** Offers a Radical Full Spectrum Doula course covering fertility, loss, birth, and postnatal support. Six months of self-paced learning plus masterclasses, mentoring, and an in-person element. They provide their own accreditation and 18 months of mentoring support. Not Doula UK approved but respected in the birth work community. Offers partial scholarships for underrepresented groups.

There are other providers too. Do your research. Ask doulas you admire where they trained. Look at the ongoing support offered, not just the initial training days. The mentoring and community you get after the course is often more valuable than the course itself.

### What Training Costs

Expect to invest between £800 and £2,500 depending on the provider and format. Some offer payment plans. The Original Birth Connection offers partial scholarships at £1,300. Most courses are tax-deductible as a business expense once you're trading.

### What Training Covers

A good doula preparation course will cover the physiology of pregnancy, labour, and birth. Comfort measures and active support techniques. The postnatal period including infant feeding. Communication skills and active listening. Consent, boundaries, and safeguarding. Working within the NHS system. Understanding medical interventions. Cultural sensitivity and inclusive practice. Setting up your business including contracts, insurance, and marketing.

You won't come out of training as a midwife. You won't be qualified to give medical advice. You will come out prepared to provide informed, compassionate, non-clinical support to families. That's what doulas do.

## Step 3: Join Doula UK (Recommended)

Membership is not compulsory but it is strongly recommended. Many families specifically look for Doula UK listed doulas. Having the Doula UK badge on your website and profile adds immediate credibility.

Membership costs a £25 joining fee followed by £9.50 per month. For that you get a profile page in their searchable directory, access to their mentoring programme, community support, events, resources, and discounts. The directory listing alone is worth the fee as it's one of the first places families look when searching for a doula.

To join as a full member you need to have completed a Doula UK approved course and gone through their mentoring and recognition process. This involves supporting a certain number of families and having your practice assessed. It takes time. But it's a structured path to professional credibility and it's respected across the UK birth work community.

If you've trained with a non-approved provider, contact Doula UK to discuss your options. They may have routes for experienced doulas trained elsewhere.

## Step 4: Get Your DBS Check

A DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service) check is not legally required for doulas, but it is expected by families and strongly recommended by Doula UK. It demonstrates that you've been checked for criminal records and are safe to work with vulnerable people.

As of January 2026, self-employed individuals can now apply for Enhanced DBS checks directly through a DBS Umbrella Body. This is a significant change. Previously, self-employed doulas could only get a Basic check unless an organisation applied on their behalf. Now you can get the full Enhanced check yourself.

To apply, find a registered DBS Umbrella Body through the GOV.UK website. They'll guide you through the process. You'll need to prove your identity and the Umbrella Body will charge an admin fee on top of the standard DBS fee. Consider joining the DBS Update Service at the same time. It lets you keep your check current so you don't have to reapply every time a family or organisation asks to see it.

Once you have your DBS certificate, you can show it to families on request. Include the fact that you're DBS checked on your website. It's a trust signal that matters.

## Step 5: Get Insured

Professional doula insurance is essential. You're working in people's homes, often during medical events. You need cover.

Look for a policy that includes public liability insurance at minimum. This covers you if someone is injured or their property is damaged while you're working. Some policies also include professional indemnity cover, which protects you if a client claims they suffered loss or harm due to your professional advice or services.

Morton Michel is one of the best-known providers of doula insurance in the UK. They offer policies specifically designed for doulas and maternity workers that account for the nature of the work, including attending births in homes and hospitals. Other providers exist so shop around, but make sure the policy explicitly covers doula work. A generic self-employed insurance policy might not.

Budget around £100 to £200 per year for a suitable policy. It's a business expense and it's non-negotiable.

## Step 6: Register with HMRC

You're self-employed. You need to tell HMRC. This isn't optional and it's not complicated.

Register as self-employed through the GOV.UK website. You need to do this by 5 October in your business's second tax year, but there's no reason not to do it straight away. Once registered you'll need to file a Self Assessment tax return each year and pay Income Tax and National Insurance on your profits.

Keep records of all your income and expenses from day one. Training costs, insurance, travel to clients' homes, phone costs, website costs, professional memberships. These are all deductible expenses that reduce your tax bill.

If your income is straightforward and you're comfortable with numbers, you can file your own return through the HMRC online system. If the thought of tax returns makes your palms sweat, a good accountant costs £150 to £300 per year for a simple self-employed return and is worth every penny.

You don't need to register as a limited company. Sole trader status is fine for most doulas. It's simpler, cheaper to run, and perfectly adequate until your income reaches a level where incorporation offers tax advantages. For most doulas, that point either never comes or comes years down the line.

## Step 7: Set Up Your Business Basics

Before you take your first client, get these foundations in place.

### A Client Contract

You need a written agreement for every client. It doesn't need to be written by a lawyer but it does need to be clear. Cover what's included in your package, the on-call period, your fee and payment terms, your cancellation policy, what happens if you're at another birth (your backup plan), confidentiality, and the scope of your role. Make explicit that you provide emotional and practical support, not medical advice or clinical care.

Many training providers include template contracts. Doula UK also has resources. Adapt them to your practice.

### A Backup Doula

Babies don't wait. If you're supporting a birth client and another client goes into labour, you need a plan. Build relationships with other local doulas who can step in if needed. Reciprocal backup arrangements are common. Make sure your clients know about this arrangement and have met or at least spoken with your backup.

### A Professional Email Address

Not your personal Gmail from 2008. yourname@yourbusiness.com looks professional. You can set this up through your domain registrar for a few pounds per month, or use Google Workspace or similar.

### A Phone Strategy

Many doulas use a separate phone number for work. A simple pay-as-you-go SIM in a second phone, or a virtual number through a service like Google Voice. This lets you set boundaries around when you're available for enquiries versus when you're on call for births.

## Step 8: Set Your Pricing

Pricing is one of the hardest decisions for new doulas. Charge too little and you'll burn out or resent the work. Charge too much before you've built a reputation and you won't get bookings.

### Birth Doula Pricing in the UK

The range is wide. Newly trained doulas often start between £500 and £800 for a birth doula package. Experienced doulas in regional areas typically charge £1,000 to £1,500. Experienced doulas in London and major cities charge £1,500 to £3,500. Some very established doulas charge more.

A standard birth doula package usually includes two to three antenatal visits, on-call availability for a defined period around the due date, continuous support during labour and birth, and one to two postnatal visits.

### Postnatal Doula Pricing

Typically charged by the hour. Rates range from about £15 per hour for new doulas outside London to £25 to £30 per hour for experienced doulas in London. Night doulas (overnight shifts of eight to twelve hours) charge per night, often £150 to £250 in London.

Some postnatal doulas offer packages of hours at a discounted rate. Ten hours at £22 per hour instead of £25, for example. This encourages longer engagements.

### Pricing Tips

Start at the lower end if you're new, but don't start at zero. Even as a newly trained doula you have value. Your training cost money and time. Your presence matters.

Raise your prices after every two or three clients. Not by huge amounts. Five to ten percent each time. You'll find your level.

Offer payment plans. Many families can afford your fee but not as a lump sum. Two or three instalments makes doula support accessible to more families.

Look at what other doulas in your area charge. Not to undercut them. To understand the market. Then price based on your experience, your costs, and the value you provide.

## Step 9: Build Your Online Presence

You need a website. You need a Google Business Profile. You need to be listed in relevant directories. This is how families find you.

### Your Website

Your website is your shop window. It needs to show who you are, what you offer, where you work, how much you charge, what families say about you, and how to get in touch. Every page needs a clear call to action pointing visitors toward booking a discovery call or sending an enquiry.

If you're comfortable building a website yourself, platforms like Squarespace and WordPress work well. If you'd rather not spend weeks on design and copy, BirthBuild creates professional doula websites through a guided conversation. You tell it about your practice and it builds your site with local SEO, the right page structure, and content written for birth work. Either way, get a website live before you start marketing.

We've written a detailed guide on [how to build a doula website that actually books clients](/blog/how-to-build-a-doula-website-that-books-clients) and a complete [doula website checklist](/blog/what-every-doula-website-needs-checklist) if you want the full breakdown.

### Google Business Profile

Free. Essential. Set it up at business.google.com. Fill in every field. Upload photos. This is how you appear in Google Maps results when someone searches "doula near me." It's arguably more important than your website for local visibility. We've covered this in depth in our guide to [doula website SEO](/blog/doula-website-seo-rank-locally).

### Directory Listings

Get listed everywhere relevant. Doula UK's directory if you're a member. The Doula Directory. Find My Doula. The Doula Club. Your training provider's graduate directory. Any local parenting networks or birth directories. Each listing is a way for families to find you and a backlink that helps your website rank.

### Social Media

Instagram is where most of the UK doula community lives. It's useful for building relationships and sharing your perspective. But don't build your entire business on rented land. Social media should drive people to your website, not replace it. A website you own is an asset. An Instagram following is at the mercy of an algorithm you don't control.

## Step 10: Get Your First Clients

The hardest clients to get are the first ones. Here's how to make it happen.

### Offer Reduced-Rate Support While Building Experience

Many newly trained doulas support their first two or three births at a reduced rate or as part of their mentoring process. This isn't working for free. It's building experience, testimonials, and confidence. Be upfront about it. "I'm a newly qualified doula building my practice and I'm offering a reduced rate of £X for my first clients. You'll receive the same level of care and commitment."

### Tell Everyone You Know

Word of mouth is still the most powerful marketing channel for doulas. Tell your friends, your family, your NCT group, your antenatal class, your yoga teacher, your GP surgery. Not in a pushy way. Just let people know you're now practising. People can't refer you if they don't know you exist.

### Connect with Local Birth Workers

Build relationships with local midwives, hypnobirthing teachers, antenatal educators, breastfeeding counsellors, and other doulas. Attend local birth network events if they exist in your area. These relationships generate referrals in both directions. A midwife who knows and trusts you will recommend you to families. A hypnobirthing teacher whose clients ask about doulas will pass on your name.

### Get Listed Online

We covered this already but it bears repeating. Doula UK directory, The Doula Directory, Find My Doula, Google Business Profile, local directories. These are where families actively search for doulas.

### Ask for Testimonials and Reviews

After every client, ask for a written testimonial and a Google review. These are the currency of trust. A new doula with three glowing Google reviews will get more enquiries than a new doula with zero. Make it easy. Send the link. Follow up once if they forget. Most families are happy to do it.

## The Ongoing Stuff

### Continuing Professional Development

The birth world evolves. Evidence changes. Best practices shift. Invest in ongoing learning. Doula UK offers CPD events. Training providers run advanced workshops. There are conferences, webinars, and reading groups. Budget time and money for this each year. It keeps your practice current and your motivation alive.

### Self-Care and Supervision

You can't pour from an empty cup. Birth work is emotionally demanding. Build in rest. Set boundaries around your on-call periods. Find a supervisor or peer support group where you can process difficult experiences. Many doulas burn out within the first few years because they give everything to their clients and nothing to themselves. Sustainability is not selfish. It's essential.

### Raising Your Prices

As you gain experience and testimonials, raise your prices. Regularly. You don't need to justify it to anyone. Your experience is worth more than it was six months ago. Your testimonials prove your value. The doulas who struggle financially are often the ones who never raise their rates.
