You trained to hold space for families during one of the most intense experiences of their lives. You did not train to fiddle with CSS. Or spend three evenings trying to make your Wix header look less like a school project.

But you need a website. Every doula does. The families who need you are searching Google right now. "Doula near me." "Birth doula London." "Postnatal support Wimbledon." If you don't show up, someone else will.

So which website builder actually makes sense for a doula in 2026? Not which one has the best ads. Not which one your friend's husband uses for his plumbing business. Which one gets you a professional site that ranks locally, builds trust, and turns visitors into enquiries?

Here's the honest breakdown.

## What a Doula Website Actually Needs

Before we compare tools, let's be clear about what your site has to do. This isn't a portfolio site for a graphic designer. It's not an online shop. A doula website has a very specific job.

It needs a warm, professional homepage with your photo and a clear explanation of what you do. An about page that tells your story and builds connection. A services page with your packages and pricing. Testimonials from real families. A contact page or booking link that's impossible to miss. And it needs to show up when someone in your area searches for a doula.

That's it. Five to seven pages. Done well. Optimised for local search. Mobile friendly. Fast loading.

Every builder on this list can technically do that. The question is how much pain is involved.

## Squarespace

Squarespace is the default recommendation and has been for years. It's what most doulas end up on. The templates look clean. The drag-and-drop editor is decent. You can get something live in a weekend if you're determined.

**What's good.** The templates are genuinely attractive. The platform handles hosting, SSL, and basic SEO. You get a professional-looking result without writing code. There's a reason half the doula websites in the UK run on Squarespace.

**What's not.** You still have to do everything yourself. Choose the template. Write all your copy. Source your images. Figure out your colour palette. Structure your pages. Write your meta descriptions. Set up your Google Business Profile. None of this is Squarespace's fault exactly. It's a general-purpose tool. But "general purpose" means it has no idea what a doula website needs. You're starting from a blank canvas with a tool designed for restaurants, photographers, and SaaS startups alike.

The other issue is ongoing cost. Squarespace runs £12 to £33 per month depending on your plan. That's £144 to £396 per year for a platform that still needs you to do all the creative and strategic work.

**Best for:** Doulas who enjoy the design process, have time to learn the platform, and want full creative control.

**Cost:** £12 to £33/month.

## Wix

Wix is the free option everyone tries first. And it shows.

**What's good.** You can get something live for free. The editor gives you total freedom over placement. There are doula-adjacent templates available. The AI site builder feature can generate a starting point from a few prompts.

**What's not.** Total freedom over placement sounds great until you realise you've spent four hours moving boxes around and your site still looks slightly off on mobile. Wix sites tend to be slower than Squarespace. The free tier includes Wix branding and ads. The templates skew American and generic. And the SEO tools, while they exist, require you to understand SEO to use them effectively.

The biggest issue with Wix is that it's easy to start and hard to finish well. You can absolutely build a doula website on Wix. But the average Wix doula site looks like it was built on Wix. And families notice. They might not be able to articulate why, but trust is a feeling. A site that looks slightly amateur creates slight doubt. In birth work, trust is everything.

**Best for:** Doulas on a very tight budget who need something live immediately and will upgrade later.

**Cost:** Free with limitations, or £10 to £25/month for premium plans.

## WordPress

WordPress powers a huge percentage of the web. It's flexible, powerful, and can do literally anything. That's both the appeal and the problem.

**What's good.** Unlimited flexibility. Thousands of themes and plugins. Strong SEO capabilities especially with plugins like Yoast or RankMath. If you want a blog that ranks, WordPress gives you the most control. Many professional doula website designers (The Website Doula, Doula Design Co, ForDoulas) build on WordPress specifically because of this flexibility.

**What's not.** WordPress has a learning curve that will make you question your life choices. Self-hosted WordPress means you need to manage hosting, updates, security patches, plugin conflicts, and backups. If a plugin breaks your site at 11pm on a Sunday, that's your problem. The good themes cost money. The good plugins cost money. And if you hire a WordPress developer to build your site properly, you're looking at £1,500 to £5,000 for a custom build, plus ongoing maintenance.

Managed WordPress hosting (like WordPress.com's paid plans) simplifies some of this. But then you're back in Squarespace territory cost-wise with less intuitive design tools.

**Best for:** Doulas who want maximum control, plan to blog seriously, or are hiring a professional web designer to build and maintain their site.

**Cost:** Self-hosted from £5/month (hosting) plus themes/plugins. Professional builds £1,500 to £5,000+.

## Showit

Showit is the newer player that's gaining traction in the birth work space. It's essentially a visual drag-and-drop builder that sits on top of WordPress for blogging.

**What's good.** Beautiful design flexibility. Feels like designing in Canva but for websites. The WordPress blog integration means your content marketing gets proper SEO treatment. There's a growing library of doula-specific templates from designers like Elizabeth McCravy and others. The community of birth workers using Showit is active and supportive.

**What's not.** Showit requires design confidence. The total freedom means you can make beautiful things or you can make a mess. It's also not cheap. Plans start around £19/month and the premium templates that actually look professional cost £200 to £500 on top.

There's also a subtle trap. Showit's strength is visual design. But a doula website's strength should be content and local SEO. You can build a stunning Showit site that doesn't rank for anything because the design was prioritised over the copy and structure.

**Best for:** Design-confident doulas who want creative freedom and plan to invest in a premium template.

**Cost:** From £19/month plus template costs (£200 to £500).

## BirthBuild

Full disclosure. We built BirthBuild. So take this section with that context. But we built it because the options above all have the same fundamental problem. They're general-purpose tools that don't know anything about birth work.

**What's good.** BirthBuild is purpose-built for doulas, midwives, hypnobirthing practitioners, and birth workers. You don't start from a blank canvas. You have a conversation. Tell us your name, your services, your location, your style preferences. The AI builds your site. Homepage, about page, services, testimonials, contact, FAQ. Structured exactly the way doula websites need to be structured. With local SEO baked in from the start.

The content is generated to match birth work language and tone. Warm. Professional. Trustworthy. Not generic marketing speak. Not American English awkwardly transplanted to a UK context. Your service area goes in the right places for local search. Your meta descriptions are written. Your site structure follows the patterns that actually rank for doulas.

You don't need to know what a meta description is. You don't need to understand colour theory. You don't need to spend a weekend watching YouTube tutorials. You tell us about your practice and we build your site.

**What's not.** BirthBuild is new. It doesn't have the track record of Squarespace or WordPress yet. If you want pixel-perfect control over every element, a general-purpose builder gives you more flexibility. And if you want a complex site with dozens of pages, custom e-commerce, or advanced functionality, BirthBuild isn't trying to be that. It's trying to be the fastest way for a birth worker to get a professional site that actually works.

**Best for:** Doulas who want a professional website without the DIY. Birth workers who'd rather spend their time supporting families than fighting with website builders.

**Cost:** See our [pricing page] for current plans.

## So Which One Should You Choose?

If you love designing things and want full creative control, Squarespace or Showit will make you happy. Budget some time and enjoy the process.

If you're hiring a professional designer and want maximum long-term flexibility, WordPress is the right foundation. Just budget for the build and ongoing maintenance.

If you need something free right now and you'll upgrade later, Wix gets you started.

If you want a professional doula website that's ready to go without the DIY, that's what BirthBuild is for. We built it because we think birth workers should spend their energy on birth work, not web design. Your website should be working for you from day one. Ranking locally. Building trust. Converting visitors into enquiries.

Whatever you choose, the most important thing is that you have a website at all. A half-decent website that exists beats a perfect website you never finish. Families are searching for doulas right now. Make sure they can find you.
